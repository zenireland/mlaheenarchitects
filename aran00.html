Coláiste Ó Díreain is an Irish language Summer School on the island of Inishmore. It is located in
<br>
Fearainn An Choirce in the middle of the island, and is adjacent to the existing National School. The
<br>
existing school is a two-roomed building designed by Boyd Barrett and built in the 1950s. The playground
<br>
to the rear was divided by a ‘shelter’ which separated the boys from the girls. The school is now mixed
<br>
and as part of this project the shelter was removed and rebuilt at the east end of the playground.
