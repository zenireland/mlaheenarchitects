  <a >
    The owner of this house wanted to extend to the rear without compromising the existing dining roomâ€™s share of the south light and view to the garden. The solution was to introduce a courtyard with reflecting pool between the existing and the new, so that both light and view to the garden were enhanced. Living now revolves around the tranquil court of still water.
