The existing premises was a typical multi-faceted shop in an Irish rural town where you could buy
<br>
anything from a pitch fork to a tweed suit. A number of extensions, repairs and accumulating stock
<br>
over a twenty year period left the shop somewhat confusing and uninviting. It was also necessary to
<br>
re-fresh the existing entrance on Trimgate Street, and to make a new entrance on Railway Street.
