title: Clontarf - 2
---
<a >
The owner of this house wanted to extend to the rear without compromising the existing dining roomâ€™s share of
<br>
the south light and view to the garden. The solution was to introduce a courtyard with reflecting pool between
<br>
the existing and the new, so that both light and view to the garden were enhanced. Living now revolves around
<br>
the tranquil court of still water.
<br>
Materials are white limestone, copper rainwater goods and iroko hardwood sliding doors and windows.
