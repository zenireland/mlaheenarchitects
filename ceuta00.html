title: Ceuta
---
<a >
  Ceuta, named after the Spanish town in North Africa where the original owners spent their honeymoon,
  <br>
  was designed by the renowned Irish Architect Michael Scott. It had fallen into disrepair over the years
  <br>
  and was damp and not very well insulated. It was also of inadequate size for the new owner; a grand
  <br>
  niece of the honeymooners. During the refurbishment the house was extended to twice the original size
  <br>
  and the features of the fa√ßade and character of the interior were restored.
