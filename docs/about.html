<h6> About: </h6>
</p>
<p>
Established in Dublin in 1995, Mary Laheen Architects engages with architecture in a number of ways
including: design of contemporary buildings; conservation of existing buildings of cultural and historical
interest; study and management of landscapes of cultural interest; writing and teaching. The contemporary
building design has an emphasis on constructional and spatial legibility and the integration of buildings
with their site context and with the natural world. The work has ranged from small-scale domestic and
commercial projects to larger-scale educational and cultural buildings.
