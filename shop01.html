Our challenge was to bring light into a  deep plan and to extend the household area. The day-lighting device
<br>
is to create ‘light towers’ which step through the plan pushing above the roof, forming a lantern-light of
<br>
glass block. The glass block presents a valuable security screen as well as diffusing the light as it enters
<br>
the shop.
<br>
The palette of materials used are granite, sandstone, white American oak, glass and stainless steel.
